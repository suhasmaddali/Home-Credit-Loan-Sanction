# Home-Credit-Loan-Sanction

Understanding the behavior of the user and whether they would pay the loan back would be quite useful. With the aid of machine learning, it would be good if we are able to predict the chances of a person in repaying the loan. 

Starting with looking at the percentage of null values present and their percentage, we would be doing data visualizations and other important things. 

With the help of machine learning and data science, it is possible to understand the behavior of the user and also learn some of the features that are important for the machine learning predictions respectively. We are going to be using the different machine learning tools and getting to know the behavior of the user and learn the different aspects of communication respectively. We are sure that the more we are learnign the machine learning tools, the better we are going to get in the long term.
